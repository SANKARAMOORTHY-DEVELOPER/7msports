            Natura was founded in 2014 by two women who were passionate about
            health and fitness. They wanted to create a safe space for women to
            workout, free from the judgment and harassment that they often
            experienced in traditional gyms.
          </p>

          <p className="text">
            The gym has helped countless women improve their health and
            wellbeing, and it continues to be a place where women can come
            together to support and motivate each other.
